    "Jupyter is an interactive web-based editor which mixes documentation with Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Notebook is split into **cells**|- the up/down cursor keys can be used to select a cell.\n",
    "When a cell is selected the left hand side will either have a **GREEN** band or a **BLUE** band.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Green means edit mode, the escape key will escape/*exit* to view mode\n",
    "- Blue means view mode, the enter key will enter edit mode (in view mode press `p` to see keyboard shortcuts)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cell is either documentation or code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python Code** cells, you will see the following in the left margin.\n",
    "  - `In [  ]:` this cell has not been run yet.\n",
    "  - `In [nn]:` this cell has been executed, the number in the square brackets in the sequence number.\n",
    "    (Note: you can execute code in any order - but in general execute top-to-bottom, although if you only want to correct a typo just re-excute that cell with `<shift>+<enter>`.\n",
    "  - The text underneath a section of code is the result (if any) from the last execution.\n",
    "  - If you are editing a cell containing python hit `<shift>+enter` to execute, or `escape` to exit without executing.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Documentation** cells use the Markdown syntax, if you are in edit mode hit `<shift>+enter` to convert to the formatted text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Other helpful keyboard shortcuts\n",
    " - `<space>` navigate to the bottom of the notebook, `<shift>+<space>` navigate to the top of the notebook\n",
    " - `c` restart the kernel clear all outputs from the notebook. **Important:** before executing anything new wait for the **Kernel Ready** to be shown in the top right corner - or count to 10. If you are importing code from other modules those changes will not take effect without the kernel restarting.\n",
    " - `r` run all outputs from the top\n",
    " - `k` kill the kernel - if you are finished with this page - it will free up memory."
